## MySQL Metrics

Metrics from MySQL, for use with both [cf-mysql-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release) and [pxc-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/pxc-release) deployed in all topologies. Many of these metrics are total counts (usually since the server started or the last `flush status`), and you may find it useful to compute averages or deltas on the client side.
